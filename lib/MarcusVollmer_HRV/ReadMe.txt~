This function computes the ECG features based on temporal as well as spectral analysis
Note: 
> winsize= window size
> wininc= window increment
> avgHR=Average Heart Rate
> meanRR= mean R-R interval distance 
> rmssd= Root Mean Square Distance of Successive R-R interval
> nn50= Number of R peaks in ECG that differ more than 50 millisecond
> pnn50= percentage NN50
> sd_RR= Standard Deviation of R-R series
> sd_HR= Standard Deviation of Heart Rate
> se= Sample Entropy
> pse= Power Spectral Entropy
> average_hrv= Average Heart Rate Variability
> hrv= Heart Rate Variability

use:[avgHR,meanRR,rmssd,nn50,pNN50,sd_RR,sd_HR,se,pse,average_hrv,hrv]= getECGFeatures(ecg_signal,winsize,wininc)
